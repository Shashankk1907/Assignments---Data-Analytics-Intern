## 🌞 PR & GHI Data Visualization Project

## 📘 Overview
This project processes and visualizes **Performance Ratio (PR)** and **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)** data of a solar PV plant.  
It was developed as part of a **Take-Home Machine Learning / Data Analysis Assessment**.

The goal is to **collate daily PR and GHI data** into a single CSV file and **generate an insightful visualization** that highlights the plant’s performance over time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Merge all PR and GHI CSV files into one consolidated dataset.
- Clean and preprocess data programmatically.
- Generate a **Performance Evolution Graph** showing:
  - 30-day moving average of PR.
  - Scatter points color-coded by GHI value.
  - Dynamic **budget line** that decreases by 0.8% every year (computed, not hardcoded).
  - Statistical summary (7-day, 30-day, 60-day average PR, etc.).
- (Bonus) Allow filtering by **custom date range**.
